# Intern Playbook

How to leverage Stanford grads to accelerate growth.

## The Situation

You have:
- Limited time (you're the only one who can build)
- Unemployed Stanford grads willing to work
- A barter strategy that needs volume

They have:
- Time
- Intelligence
- Networks (Stanford connections)
- Motivation (need experience, references, something to do)

## What They Can Do

### High Value (Do This)

| Task | Why it works |
|------|--------------|
| **Outreach & lead gen** | Find prospects, send initial DMs, book discovery calls for you |
| **Research prospects** | Before your calls: "Here's their workflow, tools they use, LinkedIn posts about pain points" |
| **Testimonial wrangling** | Chase down testimonials, schedule video calls, edit clips |
| **Content from your work** | Turn your builds into LinkedIn posts, case studies, Twitter threads |
| **Warm intro mining** | "Who in your network has recruiting/sales/ops pain?" — map their Stanford connections |
| **Follow-up sequences** | Check in with past barter partners, ask for intros |

### Medium Value

| Task | Why it works |
|------|--------------|
| **Competitive research** | What are Zapier/Make/other automation consultants doing? |
| **Community infiltration** | Join Slack groups, Discord servers, Reddit — find people complaining about manual work |
| **Event scouting** | Find meetups, webinars, conferences where your prospects hang out |
| **Documentation** | Write up how your automations work for case studies |

### Low Value (Avoid)

| Task | Why to skip |
|------|-------------|
| Building automations | You need to do this yourself to learn what works |
| Customer communication | You need the direct relationship |
| Strategy decisions | They don't have context yet |

## How to Structure It

### Option A: Commission-Based Outreach

"For every discovery call you book that shows up, I'll pay you $X / give you Y."

| Outcome | Compensation |
|---------|--------------|
| Discovery call booked + showed | $25 |
| Call converts to barter deal | $50 + "I'll be your reference" |
| **First paid deal** | **100% of first payment ($500)** |
| Subsequent paid deals | 20% of first payment ($100) |

**Why 100% on first sale:**
- Gets them hungry — $500 is real money for an unemployed grad
- You get a paying customer + case study (worth more than $500)
- Proves the model works before you scale it
- They'll talk about it and recruit other interns for you

**Pros:** Aligned incentives, only pay for results, big upside motivates them
**Cons:** They might spam people and burn your reputation

**Guardrails:**
- You approve all outreach messages before they send
- Quality over quantity — max 20 personalized DMs/day
- They CC you on everything

### Option B: Part-Time Growth Role

"Work 10-15 hrs/week on growth. I'll mentor you, give you a reference, and pay $X/hr (or equity if this takes off)."

| Hours/week | Compensation |
|------------|--------------|
| 10-15 hrs | $20-30/hr or deferred equity |

**Pros:** More control, can give broader responsibilities
**Cons:** Fixed cost even if output is low

### Option C: Barter for Barter (Recommended Starting Point)

"I'll build you a job search automation. In exchange, you do 20 hours of outreach for me."

**Job search automations you can build them:**

| Automation | What it does |
|------------|--------------|
| Application tracker | Scrape job boards, track where they applied, auto-update status |
| Follow-up drafter | "It's been 5 days since I applied to X, draft a follow-up email" |
| Resume tailor | "Here's the job description, adjust my resume bullet points" |
| Networking assistant | "Find 2nd-degree connections at this company, draft intro requests" |
| Interview prep | "Pull info about this company and the interviewer, prep me" |

**Why this is the best option:**
- No cash outlay
- They experience your product firsthand — best way to make them a believer
- They have a genuine pain (unemployment) that you're solving
- When they land a job, that's a testimonial: "June built me an automation that helped me land my job at [Company]"
- They'll tell other unemployed friends

**Cons:** Need to scope carefully so it's fair (20 hrs outreach = ~$400-600 value)

## Onboarding an Intern

### Day 1: Context

1. Walk them through Skillomatic (30 min)
2. Show them the Barter Playbook
3. Explain the ideal customer profile
4. Give them access to your CRM/tracker (even if it's just a spreadsheet)

### Week 1: Supervised Outreach

1. They draft 10 outreach messages
2. You review and give feedback
3. They send approved messages
4. Debrief on responses

### Week 2+: Independent with Check-ins

1. Daily async update: "Here's what I sent, here's what I heard back"
2. Weekly 30-min call: review pipeline, adjust targeting
3. You take all discovery calls yourself

## Scripts for Interns

### Finding Prospects

"Search LinkedIn for [recruiters at YC companies / sales ops at Series A startups / etc]. Look for people who post about being busy, overwhelmed, or manually doing repetitive tasks."

### Initial DM (for them to send on your behalf)

```
Hey [name] — I work with June at Skillomatic. He builds AI automations
that connect Claude/ChatGPT to business tools (ATS, CRM, email, etc).

He's looking for early users to build case studies — free automation
in exchange for feedback and a testimonial.

Would you be open to a 15-min call to see if there's a fit?
```

### Following Up

```
Hey [name] — just bumping this in case it got buried.

June's got a few slots this week if you're interested in a free
automation build. No pressure either way!
```

## Tracking

| Intern | Hours/week | Focus area | Calls booked | Deals closed |
|--------|------------|------------|--------------|--------------|

## Managing Quality

### Red Flags

- Sending generic copy-paste messages
- High volume, low response rate
- Prospects responding annoyed
- Not following up

### Green Flags

- Personalized messages that reference prospect's actual work
- Thoughtful research before reaching out
- Good response rates (>10% reply rate)
- Prospects saying "thanks for reaching out"

## Leverage Their Networks

Stanford grads know other Stanford grads. Many are at:
- YC startups
- Top tech companies
- Consulting firms
- VC-backed companies

**Ask them:**
> "Who do you know from Stanford who's in recruiting, sales ops, or operations? Anyone who complains about manual work or juggling too many tools?"

This is warmer than any cold outreach you could do.

## The Job Search Automation Angle

This is a secret weapon. Unemployed Stanford grads:
1. Have a painful, immediate problem (job search is tedious)
2. Have impressive networks (Stanford alumni, YC founders, tech leaders)
3. Will be grateful if you help them land a job
4. Will land at good companies where they become internal champions

**The play:**

1. Build them a job search automation (application tracking, follow-ups, interview prep)
2. They do outreach for you while job hunting
3. They land a job → testimonial: "June's automation helped me land my role at [Company]"
4. Now they're inside a company with budget → potential paid customer
5. They refer you to their new colleagues

**Testimonial to aim for:**

> "I was mass-applying and losing track of everything. June built me an automation that tracked my applications, drafted follow-ups, and prepped me for interviews. I landed at [Big Tech/Startup] two months later. Now I'm using Skillomatic to automate [recruiting/sales/ops] at work."

This testimonial does triple duty:
- Shows you help individuals (relatable)
- Shows real outcome (got a job)
- Shows B2B potential (now using it at work)

**Ask every intern:**
> "When you land your next role, would you be open to trying Skillomatic there? I'll give you free access for your first year."

Plant the seed early.
