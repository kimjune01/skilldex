# Barter Playbook

Trade automation work for things that grow the business.

## Mindset: Make Them Unreasonably Happy

YC's advice: focus on making one user extremely satisfied before moving to the next. If your barter partners become genuine advocates (not just fulfilling an obligation), their intros will be warmer and convert better.

**Your attitude:**
- You're not "doing them a favor" — you're earning their advocacy
- Treat every barter like a $10k client. The testimonial and intros are worth more than cash right now.
- Be embarrassingly responsive. Reply in minutes, not hours.
- Over-deliver on the automation. Add one thing they didn't ask for.
- Check in after delivery: "How's it going? Anything I can tweak?"

**Concrete ways to delight:**
| Action | Why it works |
|--------|--------------|
| Build it faster than promised | Exceeds expectations, shows competence |
| Send a Loom walkthrough | Personal touch, they feel supported |
| Add a small bonus feature | "I noticed you also do X, so I added that too" |
| Follow up at day 3 and day 7 | Shows you care about outcomes, not just delivery |
| Fix issues within hours | Builds trust that you'll be there |
| Celebrate their wins | "Saw you closed that role — congrats!" |
| Remember personal details | Their dog's name, their kid's soccer game |

**What "unreasonably happy" looks like:**
- They message you unsolicited to say it's working great
- They bring you up in conversation with peers without being asked
- They offer to intro you before you ask
- They feel like they got the better end of the deal

## Implementation: Being Embarrassingly Responsive

### Communication Channels (in order of responsiveness)

| Channel | Response time | When to use |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| **Text/iMessage** | Minutes | Active builds, urgent issues, quick questions |
| **Slack Connect** | < 1 hour | If they prefer Slack, ongoing collaboration |
| **Email** | Same day | Initial outreach, formal stuff, recaps |
| **Cal.com** | N/A | Scheduling only |

**Recommendation:** Give them your phone number after the discovery call.

> "Here's my cell — text me anytime if something's broken or you have a quick question. I'd rather hear from you than have you frustrated."

This signals:
- You're a real person, not a faceless vendor
- You're confident enough in your work to be reachable
- You actually want to help

### Daily Habits

| Habit | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Check texts/Slack first thing in the morning | Catch overnight issues before they fester |
| Reply immediately even if just "looking into this" | Acknowledgment > silence |
| Send unprompted updates during builds | "Just finished the calendar integration, email sync is next" |
| End-of-day recap if actively building | "Here's where we're at, tomorrow I'll tackle X" |

### Tools Setup

- **Phone:** Keep notifications on for barter contacts. Consider a Google Voice number if you want separation.
- **Slack:** Create a dedicated channel per barter partner if they use Slack
- **Loom:** Record quick videos instead of writing long explanations
- **Cal.com:** Keep slots open for quick 15-min calls during active builds

### Scripts for Common Situations

**When they report an issue:**
> "On it — give me 20 minutes and I'll have an update for you."

**When you're blocked on their end:**
> "Quick question when you get a sec — need [X] to keep moving. No rush, just don't want to hold things up."

**When you finish something:**
> "Just shipped [feature]. Here's a 2-min Loom showing how it works: [link]. Let me know if anything feels off."

**Proactive check-in (day 3):**
> "Hey! How's the automation working? Anything weird or could be better?"

**Proactive check-in (day 7):**
> "Been a week — is it saving you time? Any tweaks you'd want?"

## The Deal

"I'll build you a free automation. In exchange, [thing that helps me]."

## What to Ask For

### High Value

| Ask | Why it matters |
|-----|----------------|
| **Warm intro to 3 people** who have repetitive workflows | Direct pipeline |
| **Case study with your name/company** | Social proof for landing page |
| **LinkedIn post about the automation** | Reach their network |
| **10-min video testimonial** | Trust builder for sales calls |
| **Co-host a webinar** on workflow automation | Lead gen + credibility |

### Medium Value

| Ask | Why it matters |
|-----|----------------|
| **Review on G2/Capterra** (when ready) | SEO + buying signals |
| **Quote for the website** | Social proof |
| **Slack/Discord community post** | Access to niche audiences |
| **Newsletter mention** | Borrowed audience |
| **Podcast guest spot** | Long-form credibility |

### Lower Value (but still useful)

| Ask | Why it matters |
|-----|----------------|
| **Feedback call after 2 weeks** | Product insights |
| **Twitter/X thread** | Visibility |
| **Upvote on Product Hunt** (when launching) | Launch momentum |

## Who to Target

Best barter candidates have:

1. **A painful repetitive workflow** - so the automation is actually valuable to them
2. **An audience or network** - so their endorsement reaches people
3. **Credibility in a niche** - recruiter at known company, sales leader, ops person at startup

### Good Targets

- Recruiters at YC companies (network + credibility)
- Sales folks with LinkedIn following
- Ops people at growing startups (they know other ops people)
- Founders who post about productivity/tools
- Agency owners (they have clients with same problems)

### Skip

- People with no online presence (can't amplify)
- Enterprise employees (can't make decisions or post publicly)
- People who don't actually have a workflow problem

## How to Pitch

### Cold DM Template

```
Hey [name] - I'm building automation tools that connect Claude/ChatGPT
to business tools (ATS, CRM, email, etc).

Looking for early users to build case studies. I'll build you a free
automation for [specific workflow you noticed they do] - in exchange
for a testimonial and intro to 2-3 people who might benefit.

Interested?
```

### Warm Intro Template

```
Hey [name] - [mutual friend] mentioned you spend a lot of time on
[workflow]. I'm building AI automations and looking for people to
trade with - free automation in exchange for a case study and intros.

Want to chat for 15 min to see if there's a fit?
```

## Tracking

| Name | Workflow | What they gave | Status |
|------|----------|----------------|--------|
| | | | |

## Rules

1. **Only build things that showcase the platform** - ATS, CRM, email, calendar integrations
2. **Schedule the testimonial before you start building** - "Let's book 15 min next Friday for a quick video call once it's working." If they won't commit to that, they're not serious — move on.
3. **Set expectations on timeline** - "I'll have this done in 2-3 days"
4. **Don't over-invest** - if they ghost after the call, move on
5. **Document everything** - screenshots, quotes, metrics for case studies

## Timeline

This is a 4-6 week play, not a long-term strategy.

**Goal:** 5-10 case studies + 20-30 warm intros

After that, you have enough social proof to switch to paid. Barter doesn't scale — your time is the bottleneck.
