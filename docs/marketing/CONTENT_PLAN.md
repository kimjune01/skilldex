# Skillomatic Content Marketing Plan

## Market Position

**Core insight:** One-person businesses are exploding (29.8M in U.S., rising). They're drowning in admin tasks across fragmented tools. AI makes it possible to run a business solo, but existing tools (Zapier, Lindy) are complex or expensive.

**Positioning:** "Claude that runs your business ops"

## Target Audiences

### Primary: Solopreneurs (Scale Play)

| Segment | Pain | What they use now |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| Digital solopreneurs | Tool fragmentation, admin overwhelm | Notion, Sheets, Stripe, Gmail |
| Solo trades (plumbers, electricians, etc.) | Hate paperwork, no time to learn software | Sheets, Calendar, maybe Wave |
| Freelancers/consultants | Client management, invoicing follow-up | Airtable, Gmail, Calendly |

**Market size:** 29.8M solopreneurs in U.S., 50.9% of workforce will be freelancers by 2027

**Key stats:**
- 60% underestimated how many hats they'd wear
- 90% feel burdened by tasks they could automate
- 40% spend 4+ hours/week on manual invoicing
- They already pay for Claude/ChatGPT - we make it 10x more valuable

### Secondary: Founders (Credibility Play)

| Why | Role |
|-----|------|
| Influential - share tools they use | Lighthouse customers |
| High willingness to pay | Case studies |
| Less crowded than recruiting/sales | Testimonials |

**Strategy:** A few happy founders → organic distribution → credibility for solopreneur marketing

## Distribution Channels

- **TikTok** - Trades, lifestyle solopreneurs, high reach

### Tier 2 (Secondary)
- **YouTube Shorts** - Searchable, evergreen
- **LinkedIn** - Founders, professional solopreneurs

- **Indie Hackers** - Builder community
- **Hacker News** - Technical credibility

## Demo Production Guidelines

### Format
- Vertical (9:16) for TikTok/Shorts/LinkedIn
- 30-60 seconds for short-form
- 2-3 minutes for deep dives

### Structure
1. **Hook (0-3 sec):** Problem statement or surprising result
2. **Setup (3-10 sec):** Quick context
3. **Demo (10-45 sec):** Show the workflow
4. **Result (45-60 sec):** What we accomplished, time saved

### Audio
- Voiceover or text overlay (many watch muted)
- Trending audio optional for TikTok reach

## Messaging Framework

### Don't Say
- "AI assistant" (generic, crowded)
- "Automation platform" (sounds complex)
- "Workflow builder" (they don't want to build)

### Do Say
- "Claude for your business"
- "Your tools, finally talking to each other"
- "Ask questions, get answers from your actual data"
- "The glue your tech stack is missing"
- "You don't need to learn software. Just ask."

### Key Differentiators
1. **No new tools to learn** - Works with what you already use
2. **Conversational** - Just ask, don't configure
3. **Multi-tool orchestration** - Everything connected
4. **Affordable** - Cheaper than VA, simpler than Zapier

## Pricing Strategy

| Segment | Target Price | Rationale |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| Solopreneurs | $50-100/month | Less than VA, comparable to other tools |
| Trades | $30-50/month | More price-sensitive, ROI must be obvious |
| Founders | $100-200/month | Higher willingness to pay |

**Positioning:** "If it helps you collect one overdue invoice, it pays for itself"

## Content Calendar

### Week 1-2: Foundation
- [ ] Record S1 (overdue invoices)
- [ ] Record S3 (prep my day)
- [ ] Record T1 (who owes me - trades version)
- [ ] Post daily on TikTok + Twitter

### Week 3-4: Expand
- [ ] Record F1 (morning briefing)
- [ ] Record S2 (cold leads)
- [ ] Record T2 (what's tomorrow)
- [ ] Test founder content on Twitter

### Week 5-6: Iterate
- [ ] Analyze what's getting traction
- [ ] Double down on winning format/platform
- [ ] Kill what's not working

## Success Metrics

### Leading Indicators
- Video views/impressions
- Engagement rate (likes, comments, shares)
- Profile visits
- Website traffic from social

### Lagging Indicators
- Waitlist sign-ups
- Demo requests
- Conversions
- Word-of-mouth referrals

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Positioning | Weakness |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Zapier/Make | Automation platform | Complex setup, not conversational |
| Lindy AI | AI employee | Expensive, inconsistent, steep learning curve |
| ChatGPT/Claude alone | General AI | No tool connections, manual copy-paste |
| Virtual assistants | Human help | $2-5k/month, async, training required |
| Vertical tools (Jobber, etc.) | Trade-specific | Complex, expensive, low adoption |

**Our angle:**
- Simpler than Zapier (just talk to it)
- Cheaper than Lindy or VA
- More powerful than raw ChatGPT (actually connected)
- No learning curve (unlike vertical software)

## Integration Constraints

| Tool | API Status | Priority |
|------|------------|----------|
| Gmail | Open | High |
| Google Calendar | Open | High |
| Google Sheets | Open | High |
| Stripe | Open | High |
| Airtable | Open | Medium |
| Wave | Check API | Medium (trades) |
| Notion | Limited | Low |
| Slack | Locked down (May 2025) | Skip |

**Focus on:** Gmail + Calendar + Sheets + Stripe. Covers 80% of use cases.

## Segment Comparison

| Aspect | Solopreneurs | Trades | Founders |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Market size | Large (30M) | Large (subset) | Small |
| Tech savviness | Medium | Low | High |
| Willingness to pay | Medium-high | Medium | Very high |
| Onboarding tolerance | Medium | Very low | High |
| Distribution | Content marketing | TikTok/Facebook | Word of mouth |
| Role | Volume/revenue | Niche test | Credibility |

## Key Principles

1. **Ship demos fast** - Stop researching, start posting
2. **Simple onboarding** - Gmail + Calendar + one Sheet, that's it
3. **Parallel test** - Solopreneurs + Founders simultaneously
4. **Kill fast** - If it's not working in 2 weeks, move on
5. **Double down on winners** - When something works, do more of it

## Notes

- Solopreneur market is 29.8M in U.S. and growing
- Trades are high-pain but need dead-simple onboarding (<10 min)
- Founders are lighthouse customers, not primary revenue
- Slack API locked down May 2025 - not viable without Marketplace approval
- They already pay for Claude/ChatGPT - we make that subscription more valuable
