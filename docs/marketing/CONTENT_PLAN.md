# Skillomatic Content Marketing Plan

## Market Position

**Core insight:** Solopreneurs and freelancers are told they need 10 SaaS subscriptions to run a business: CRM, invoicing, task management, expense tracking, scheduling. They don't want to sign up for all that. They don't want to learn new UIs. They just want to talk and have it handled.

**Positioning:** "You don't need 10 SaaS tools. You need Claude + one Google account."

**Key differentiator:** No new signups. No new UIs. Just talk to Claude – it reads and writes to your Google Sheets, Gmail, and Calendar. Sheets is the silent backend they never have to open.

## Target Audiences

### Primary: Anti-SaaS Solopreneurs

People who need to track clients, invoices, and tasks but **refuse to sign up for more software**.

| Segment | Pain | What they do now |
|---------|------|------------------|
| Freelancers (designers, writers, devs) | Client management, invoicing, follow-ups | Notes app, memory, chaos |
| Creatives (photographers, videographers) | Tracking shoots, payments, deliverables | Paper, scattered notes |
| Coaches/consultants | Client notes, scheduling, session tracking | Basic calendar, nothing else |
| Content creators | Brand deals, posting schedule, income | Spreadsheets they hate or ignore |

**What they have in common:**
- Already have a Google account
- Already pay for Claude or ChatGPT
- Hate admin, hate learning new tools
- Would rather text than click through a UI
- Don't want another monthly subscription

**Market size:** 29.8M solopreneurs in U.S., 50.9% of workforce will be freelancers by 2027

**Key stats:**
- 60% underestimated how many hats they'd wear
- 90% feel burdened by tasks they could automate
- 40% spend 4+ hours/week on manual invoicing

### Secondary: Founders (Credibility Play)

| Why | Role |
|-----|------|
| Influential - share tools they use | Lighthouse customers |
| High willingness to pay | Case studies |
| Less crowded than recruiting/sales | Testimonials |

**Strategy:** A few happy founders → organic distribution → credibility for solopreneur marketing

## Demo Strategy

### The Big Idea

Every demo should show TWO things:
1. **Read:** Pull information from their tools
2. **Write:** Actually update their data (the "wow" moment)

This is what separates us from ChatGPT - we close the loop.

## Distribution Channels

### Tier 1 (Primary)
- **Twitter/X** - Solopreneurs, indie hackers, founders
- **TikTok** - Trades, lifestyle solopreneurs, high reach

### Tier 2 (Secondary)
- **YouTube Shorts** - Searchable, evergreen
- **LinkedIn** - Founders, professional solopreneurs

### Tier 3 (Community)
- **Reddit** - r/solopreneur, r/Entrepreneur, r/freelance, trade-specific subs
- **Facebook Groups** - Trade communities (huge and active)
- **Indie Hackers** - Builder community
- **Hacker News** - Technical credibility

## Demo Production Guidelines

### Format
- Vertical (9:16) for TikTok/Shorts/LinkedIn
- 30-60 seconds for short-form
- 2-3 minutes for deep dives

### Structure
1. **Hook (0-3 sec):** Problem statement or surprising result
2. **Setup (3-10 sec):** Quick context
3. **Demo (10-45 sec):** Show the workflow - READ then WRITE
4. **Result (45-60 sec):** Show the updated data, time saved

### The "Write" Moment
Every demo should have a moment where the data actually changes:
- Invoice marked paid
- Task checked off
- Expense logged
- Note added

This is the differentiator. Show the spreadsheet updating in real-time if possible.

### Audio
- Voiceover or text overlay (many watch muted)
- Trending audio optional for TikTok reach

## Messaging Framework

### Don't Say
- "AI assistant" (generic, crowded)
- "Automation platform" (sounds complex)
- "Workflow builder" (they don't want to build)
- "Integrates with" (passive, boring)
- "Your spreadsheet becomes smart" (they don't want to think about spreadsheets)

### Do Say
- "You don't need a CRM. Just tell Claude."
- "Skip the software. Just talk."
- "No new signups. No new UIs. Just ask."
- "Claude + Google account. That's your whole stack."
- "Stop paying for tools you hate using."

### Key Differentiators
1. **Anti-SaaS** - Replace 10 subscriptions with one conversation
2. **Zero UI** - They never have to open a spreadsheet
3. **No onboarding** - Already have Google, already have Claude
4. **Conversational** - Just talk, don't configure

### One-liner Options
- "You don't need 10 SaaS tools. You need Claude."
- "Your business backend, invisible."
- "Skip the software. Just talk."
- "CRM, invoicing, tasks – all in one conversation."

## Pricing Strategy

| Segment | Target Price | Rationale |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| Solopreneurs | $50-100/month | Less than VA, comparable to other tools |
| Trades | $30-50/month | More price-sensitive, ROI must be obvious |
| Founders | $100-200/month | Higher willingness to pay |

**Positioning:** "If it helps you collect one overdue invoice, it pays for itself"

## Content Calendar

### Week 1-2: Foundation (Read + Write demos)
- [ ] Record S1 (overdue invoices + mark paid)
- [ ] Record T3 (log job - trades)
- [ ] Record S3 (prep my day + check off task)
- [ ] Post daily on TikTok + Twitter

### Week 3-4: Expand
- [ ] Record S6 (log expense)
- [ ] Record S2 (cold leads + log outreach)
- [ ] Record T1 (who owes me - trades version)
- [ ] Test founder content on Twitter

### Week 5-6: Iterate
- [ ] Analyze what's getting traction
- [ ] Double down on winning format/platform
- [ ] Kill what's not working

## Success Metrics

### Leading Indicators
- Video views/impressions
- Engagement rate (likes, comments, shares)
- Profile visits
- Website traffic from social

### Lagging Indicators
- Waitlist sign-ups
- Demo requests
- Conversions
- Word-of-mouth referrals

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Positioning | Weakness |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| HubSpot, Pipedrive | CRM | Another signup, another UI, overkill for solopreneurs |
| QuickBooks, Wave | Invoicing/accounting | Complex, intimidating, monthly fee |
| Asana, Todoist, Notion | Task/project management | Yet another tool to check |
| Zapier/Make | Automation platform | Complex setup, not conversational |
| Lindy AI | AI employee | Expensive, inconsistent, steep learning curve |
| ChatGPT/Claude alone | General AI | No tool connections, can't update data |
| Virtual assistants | Human help | $2-5k/month, async, training required |

**Our angle:**
- **Anti-SaaS** - Don't sign up for 10 tools, just use Claude
- **Zero UI** - Never open a spreadsheet, just talk
- **Already have everything** - Google account + Claude subscription
- **Actually updates your data** - Unlike raw ChatGPT

## Integration Strategy

### Core Stack (Required)
| Tool | Capability | Priority |
|------|------------|----------|
| Google Sheets | **Read + Write** | Critical |
| Gmail | Read + Send | Critical |
| Google Calendar | Read | Critical |
| Stripe | Read | High |

**This is the stack.** Gmail + Calendar + Sheets + Stripe covers 90% of use cases.

Sheets is the database. Everything writes back to Sheets.

### Optional (Nice to have)
| Tool | Capability | Priority |
|------|------------|----------|
| Airtable | Read + Write | Low (Sheets preferred) |
| Wave | Read | Low (trades who use it) |
| Notion | Read | Low (limited API) |

### Not Pursuing
- Slack (API locked down May 2025)
- QuickBooks (complex OAuth, Sheets is simpler)

## Segment Comparison

| Aspect | Solopreneurs | Trades | Founders |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Market size | Large (30M) | Large (subset) | Small |
| Tech savviness | Medium | Low | High |
| Willingness to pay | Medium-high | Medium | Very high |
| Onboarding tolerance | Medium | Very low | High |
| Distribution | Content marketing | TikTok/Facebook | Word of mouth |
| Key demo | Cold leads, client status | Log job, who owes me | Morning briefing |
| Role | Volume/revenue | Niche test | Credibility |

## Key Principles

1. **Show the write** - Every demo should update data, not just read it
2. **Sheets is invisible** - They never see the spreadsheet, just the conversation
3. **Anti-SaaS messaging** - "You don't need X tool, just tell Claude"
4. **Ship demos fast** - Stop researching, start posting
5. **Zero onboarding** - Gmail + Calendar, that's it (Sheets created automatically)
6. **Kill fast** - If it's not working in 2 weeks, move on
7. **Double down on winners** - When something works, do more of it

## Available Skills (for demos)

| Skill | Read | Write | Best For |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| `overdue-invoices` | Invoices from Stripe/Sheets | Mark paid | S1, T1 |
| `cold-leads` | Leads from Sheets, Gmail history | Update status, log outreach | S2 |
| `morning-briefing` | Calendar, email, tasks | Mark tasks done | S3, T2, F1 |
| `client-status` | Emails, invoices, notes | Add notes, add clients | S5 |
| `meeting-prep` | Calendar, email history | - | F2 |
| `inbox-review` | Unanswered emails | - | F4 |
| `revenue-summary` | Stripe, Sheets | - | S4, T4 |
| `log-expense` | - | Add expense | S6, T5 |
| `log-job` | - | Add completed job | T3 |
| `add-task` | - | Add task | S7 |
| `email-draft` | Search emails | Send/draft emails | Any |

## Notes

- Solopreneur market is 29.8M in U.S. and growing
- Target: people who refuse to sign up for more software
- Founders are lighthouse customers, not primary revenue
- Slack API locked down May 2025 - not viable without Marketplace approval
- They already pay for Claude/ChatGPT - we make that subscription more valuable
- **Sheets is invisible infrastructure** - they talk to Claude, never open the spreadsheet
- **Anti-SaaS positioning** - replace CRM + invoicing + tasks with one conversation
