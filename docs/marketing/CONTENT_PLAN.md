# Skillomatic Content Marketing Plan

## Market Position

**Core insight:** Solopreneurs and freelancers have fragmented tools that don't talk to each other. They're trapped by inertia — their "good enough" system took forever to set up and switching isn't worth the marginal gains. They use ChatGPT daily but haven't realized it could be the control center for everything.

**Positioning:** "Ask ChatGPT to handle your business busywork."

**Key differentiator:** Automation without configuration. No workflow builders, no "if this then that" setup. Just describe what you want and it happens. Like it? Schedule it to repeat forever.

**The journey they experience:**
1. "ChatGPT, do this annoying thing for me" → relief
2. It works → surprise/delight
3. "Wait, it can do this *every week*?" → magic

Automation isn't the pitch. It's the unexpected payoff after they're already happy.

## Target Audiences

### Primary: Founders / Freelancers / Consultants with Email History

People with years of relationships buried in email who want to activate them without data entry.

| Segment | Pain | What they do now |
|---------|------|------------------|
| Founders | Pipeline, follow-ups, admin | Scattered across tools |
| Freelancers (designers, writers, devs) | Client management, invoicing | Notes app, memory, chaos |
| Consultants | Client notes, warm outreach | Basic calendar, email search |

**What they have in common:**
- Already use ChatGPT or Claude daily
- Trapped by inertia (system took forever to set up)
- Context-switching fatigue (alt-tabbing between doing work and tracking work)
- Haven't realized AI could handle the busywork

**Market tailwind:** Economic uncertainty creates more solopreneurs. They'll grow into paid tiers as their needs multiply.

### ICP for First Skill (Warm Contacts CRM)

People with years of relationships buried in email who want to:
1. Surface warm contacts without manual data entry
2. Run outreach campaigns
3. Track campaign stages conversationally

### Secondary: Users who grow into Pro tier

Multi-person businesses who start on Free/Basic and eventually need CRM, ATS, or accounting integrations.

## Demo Strategy

### The Big Idea

Every demo should show TWO things:
1. **Read:** Pull information from their tools
2. **Write:** Actually update their data (the "wow" moment)

This is what separates us from ChatGPT - we close the loop.

## Distribution Channels

### Tier 1 (Primary)
- **Warm outreach** - Use the product to sell the product. First paying customer comes from here.

### Tier 2 (Secondary)
- **LinkedIn** - Where ICP hangs out, but they're not looking for AI products

### Tier 3 (Tertiary)
- **Reddit** - Astroturfed, low trust, long game at best

**Key insight:** These people use ChatGPT daily but don't seek out AI products. They won't find you — you have to reach them directly.

**Channel strategy:**
1. Build the warm contacts skill
2. Use it on yourself
3. Reach out to your own network
4. First paying customer validates everything

## Demo Production Guidelines

### Format
- Vertical (9:16) for TikTok/Shorts/LinkedIn
- 30-60 seconds for short-form
- 2-3 minutes for deep dives

### Structure
1. **Hook (0-3 sec):** Problem statement or surprising result
2. **Setup (3-10 sec):** Quick context
3. **Demo (10-45 sec):** Show the workflow - READ then WRITE
4. **Result (45-60 sec):** Show the updated data, time saved

### The "Write" Moment
Every demo should have a moment where the data actually changes:
- Invoice marked paid
- Task checked off
- Expense logged
- Note added

This is the differentiator. Show the spreadsheet updating in real-time if possible.

### Audio
- Voiceover or text overlay (many watch muted)
- Trending audio optional for TikTok reach

## Messaging Framework

### Don't Say
- "AI assistant" (generic, crowded)
- "Automation platform" (sounds complex)
- "Workflow builder" (they don't want to build)
- "Anti-SaaS" (made up, not validated)
- "Your spreadsheet becomes smart" (they don't want to think about spreadsheets)

### Do Say
- "Ask ChatGPT to handle it."
- "Automation without configuration."
- "No new system to learn. No migration. Just ask."
- "Like it? Schedule it to repeat forever."
- "ChatGPT + $5/mo = your whole business backend."

### Key Differentiators
1. **Works with ChatGPT** - The AI they already use daily
2. **Automation without configuration** - No workflow builders, no "if this then that"
3. **No migration** - Works with their existing tools
4. **The magic reveal** - Automation is the unexpected payoff, not the pitch

### One-liner
"Ask ChatGPT to handle your business busywork."

### The Journey
1. They ask for help with something tedious
2. It gets done
3. Later they discover it can just... keep happening

## Pricing Strategy

| Tier | Price | Integrations | Limits | Who |
|------|-------|--------------|--------|-----|
| Free | $0 | GSuite, Calendly/Cal.com, time tracking | 10 calls/week, 3 cron jobs | Trying it out |
| Basic | $5/month | Same as free | Unlimited | One-person businesses |
| Pro | $50/month | + CRM, ATS, Accounting, Finance | Unlimited | Multi-person businesses |

**Consulting:** $500 one-time custom build. Validates demand for Pro tier.

**Conversion logic:**
- Free: Try everything, capped usage
- $5: You're using it regularly, worth a coffee/month
- $50: You need multiplayer integrations

**The moat:** User's configured skills + cron jobs. 12 automations later, they're locked in by their own setup.

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Positioning | Weakness |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| HubSpot, Pipedrive | CRM | Another signup, another UI, overkill for solopreneurs |
| QuickBooks, Wave | Invoicing/accounting | Complex, intimidating, monthly fee |
| Asana, Todoist, Notion | Task/project management | Yet another tool to check |
| Zapier/Make | Automation platform | Complex setup, not conversational |
| Lindy AI | AI employee | Expensive, inconsistent, steep learning curve |
| ChatGPT/Claude alone | General AI | No tool connections, can't update data |
| Virtual assistants | Human help | $2-5k/month, async, training required |

**Our angle:**
- **Anti-SaaS** - Don't sign up for 10 tools, just use Claude
- **Zero UI** - Never open a spreadsheet, just talk
- **Already have everything** - Google account + Claude subscription
- **Actually updates your data** - Unlike raw ChatGPT

## Integration Strategy

### Core Stack (Required)
| Tool | Capability | Priority |
|------|------------|----------|
| Google Sheets | **Read + Write** | Critical |
| Gmail | Read + Send | Critical |
| Google Calendar | Read | Critical |
| Stripe | Read | High |

**This is the stack.** Gmail + Calendar + Sheets + Stripe covers 90% of use cases.

Sheets is the database. Everything writes back to Sheets.

### Optional (Nice to have)
| Tool | Capability | Priority |
|------|------------|----------|
| Airtable | Read + Write | Low (Sheets preferred) |
| Wave | Read | Low (trades who use it) |
| Notion | Read | Low (limited API) |

### Not Pursuing
- Slack (API locked down May 2025)
- QuickBooks (complex OAuth, Sheets is simpler)

## Segment Comparison

| Aspect | Solopreneurs | Trades | Founders |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Market size | Large (30M) | Large (subset) | Small |
| Tech savviness | Medium | Low | High |
| Willingness to pay | Medium-high | Medium | Very high |
| Onboarding tolerance | Medium | Very low | High |
| Distribution | Content marketing | TikTok/Facebook | Word of mouth |
| Key demo | Cold leads, client status | Log job, who owes me | Morning briefing |
| Role | Volume/revenue | Niche test | Credibility |

## Key Principles

1. **Show the write** - Every demo should update data, not just read it
2. **Sheets is invisible** - They never see the spreadsheet, just the conversation
3. **Anti-SaaS messaging** - "You don't need X tool, just tell Claude"
4. **Ship demos fast** - Stop researching, start posting
5. **Zero onboarding** - Gmail + Calendar, that's it (Sheets created automatically)
6. **Kill fast** - If it's not working in 2 weeks, move on
7. **Double down on winners** - When something works, do more of it

## Available Skills (for demos)

| Skill | Read | Write | Best For |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| `overdue-invoices` | Invoices from Stripe/Sheets | Mark paid | S1, T1 |
| `cold-leads` | Leads from Sheets, Gmail history | Update status, log outreach | S2 |
| `morning-briefing` | Calendar, email, tasks | Mark tasks done | S3, T2, F1 |
| `client-status` | Emails, invoices, notes | Add notes, add clients | S5 |
| `meeting-prep` | Calendar, email history | - | F2 |
| `inbox-review` | Unanswered emails | - | F4 |
| `revenue-summary` | Stripe, Sheets | - | S4, T4 |
| `log-expense` | - | Add expense | S6, T5 |
| `log-job` | - | Add completed job | T3 |
| `add-task` | - | Add task | S7 |
| `email-draft` | Search emails | Send/draft emails | Any |

## Notes

- Solopreneur market is 29.8M in U.S. and growing
- Target: people who refuse to sign up for more software
- Founders are lighthouse customers, not primary revenue
- Slack API locked down May 2025 - not viable without Marketplace approval
- They already pay for Claude/ChatGPT - we make that subscription more valuable
- **Sheets is invisible infrastructure** - they talk to Claude, never open the spreadsheet
- **Anti-SaaS positioning** - replace CRM + invoicing + tasks with one conversation
