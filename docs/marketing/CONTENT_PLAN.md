# Skillomatic Content Marketing Plan

## Market Position

**Core insight:** Gem has become the all-in-one recruiting platform (ATS + CRM + sourcing + email + scheduling + AI). We don't compete with Gem - we serve everyone who can't or won't switch to Gem.

**Positioning:** "Gem-like AI for teams that can't/won't migrate to Gem"

## Target Audience

### Primary: Companies NOT on Gem

| Segment | Why they're stuck | Pain we solve |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| Small teams (<5 recruiters) | Can't justify $20k+/year for Gem | AI-powered workflows at fraction of cost |
| Mid-market on Greenhouse/Lever | Migration pain > benefit | Keep your ATS, add AI capabilities |
| Budget-conscious teams | Greenhouse + free tools is cheaper | Upgrade without switching platforms |
| Low-volume hiring | Don't need Gem's scale | Right-sized AI assistance |

### Secondary: Non-recruiting use cases
- Sales ops (CRM + email + calendar orchestration)
- Operations (cross-tool automation)
- Founders/execs (daily briefings, email triage)

## Content Strategy

### Phase 1: Demo Videos (Prove It Works)

Short-form (30-60 sec) for LinkedIn/Twitter/TikTok:

#### Demo 1: "One Sentence to Find Candidates"
- **Hook:** "I just replaced 20 minutes of ATS clicking with one sentence"
- **Show:** Type natural language query → get ranked candidates with fit analysis
- **Platform:** LinkedIn (primary), Twitter
- **Target:** Recruiters frustrated with ATS UI

#### Demo 2: "Weekly Report in 5 Seconds"
- **Hook:** "My Monday morning report now takes 5 seconds"
- **Show:** Type "recruiting metrics for Slack" → formatted report appears
- **Platform:** LinkedIn, Twitter
- **Target:** Recruiting managers, ops people

#### Demo 3: "Cross-Tool Magic"
- **Hook:** "Search ATS + draft emails + check calendar - one conversation"
- **Show:** Multi-step workflow completing in single chat
- **Platform:** LinkedIn, Twitter
- **Target:** Power users, ops people

#### Demo 4: "Your ATS + AI (No Migration Required)"
- **Hook:** "You don't need to switch to Gem to get AI recruiting"
- **Show:** Greenhouse/Lever user getting Gem-like capabilities
- **Platform:** LinkedIn

### Phase 2: Comparison Content

#### Blog/Thread: "Gem vs Staying on Greenhouse + Skillomatic"
- Cost comparison ($20k+ vs current stack + Skillomatic)
- Migration pain avoided
- What you get vs what you give up
- Decision framework

#### Blog/Thread: "What Gem Does That You Actually Need"
- Break down Gem's features
- Which ones matter for your team size
- How to get 80% of value without switching

### Phase 3: Use Case Deep Dives

Longer content (2-5 min videos, blog posts):

1. **Candidate Search Workflows**
   - Natural language → ATS query
   - Fit analysis and ranking
   - Comparison to manual search

2. **Outreach Drafting**
   - Context-aware email generation
   - Personalization at scale
   - Integration with Gmail/Outlook

3. **Reporting Automation**
   - Pulling from multiple sources
   - Different formats (Slack, email, standup)
   - Real metrics, not manual compilation

4. **Non-Recruiting Workflows**
   - Sales: CRM + email orchestration
   - Ops: Cross-tool automation
   - Founders: Daily briefing setup

## Distribution Channels

### Tier 1 (Primary)
- **LinkedIn** - Where recruiters and ops people live
- **Twitter/X** - AI/dev crowd, tech recruiters

### Tier 2 (Secondary)
- **TikTok** - Higher reach ceiling, less targeted
- **YouTube Shorts** - Searchable, evergreen

### Tier 3 (Community)
- **Reddit** - r/recruiting, r/recruitinghell, r/sales
- **Slack/Discord** - Recruiting communities, AI communities
- **Hacker News** - Dev audience, technical credibility

## Demo Production Guidelines

### Format
- Vertical (9:16) for LinkedIn/TikTok/Shorts
- 30-60 seconds for short-form
- 2-3 minutes for deep dives

### Structure
1. **Hook (0-3 sec):** Problem statement or surprising result
2. **Setup (3-10 sec):** Quick context on what we're doing
3. **Demo (10-45 sec):** Show the actual workflow
4. **Result (45-60 sec):** What we accomplished, time saved

### Audio
- Voiceover or text overlay (many watch muted)
- Trending audio optional for TikTok reach

### Text
- Problem at start
- Key moments highlighted
- Result/CTA at end

## Messaging Framework

### Don't Say
- "Replace your ATS"
- "Better than Gem"
- "AI-powered recruiting platform"

### Do Say
- "Keep your Greenhouse/Lever, add AI"
- "Gem-like capabilities without the migration"
- "Natural language for your recruiting tools"
- "Claude for your ATS + email + calendar"

### Key Differentiators
1. **No migration required** - Works with existing tools
2. **Multi-tool orchestration** - Not just ATS, everything together
3. **Fraction of the cost** - Compared to Gem pricing
4. **Privacy-first** - Ephemeral architecture, no data stored

## Competitive Landscape Notes

### Gem (the 800lb gorilla)
- All-in-one: ATS + CRM + sourcing + email + scheduling + analytics
- $99/user/month (~$4k/seat/year)
- 650M+ profile database
- Native AI in every workflow
- Target: Mid-market to enterprise, well-funded startups

### Traditional ATS (our integration targets)
- **Greenhouse** - Structured hiring, DE&I focus, 1000+ integrations
- **Lever** - Beautiful UI, good CRM, $12k+/year
- **Ashby** - Modern, analytics-focused, rising
- **Workable** - SMB-friendly, 30k+ customers
- **Zoho Recruit** - Budget option, mobile-first

### Why Companies Stay on Traditional ATS
1. Sunk cost (already paid for setup, training)
2. Migration pain (data, workflows, integrations)
3. Cost (Gem is expensive)
4. "Good enough" (don't need all-in-one)
5. Compliance/IT requirements (enterprise)

## Notes

- Gem does NOT have a public API that enables third-party AI tools - their AI is proprietary
- Gem API requires contacting sales for access (not self-serve)
- Traditional ATS (Greenhouse, Lever) have more open APIs
- This is our moat: we can integrate with the ATS that Gem competes against
