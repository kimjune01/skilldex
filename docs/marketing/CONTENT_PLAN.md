# Skillomatic Content Marketing Plan

## Market Position

**Core insight:** Gem has become the all-in-one recruiting platform (ATS + CRM + sourcing + email + scheduling + AI). We don't compete with Gem - we serve everyone who can't or won't switch to Gem.

**Positioning:** "Gem-like AI for teams that can't/won't migrate to Gem"

## Target Audience

### Primary: Companies NOT on Gem

| Segment | Why they're stuck | Pain we solve |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| Small teams (<5 recruiters) | Can't justify $20k+/year for Gem | AI-powered workflows at fraction of cost |
| Mid-market on Greenhouse/Lever | Migration pain > benefit | Keep your ATS, add AI capabilities |
| Budget-conscious teams | Greenhouse + free tools is cheaper | Upgrade without switching platforms |
| Low-volume hiring | Don't need Gem's scale | Right-sized AI assistance |

### Secondary: Non-recruiting use cases
- Sales ops (CRM + email + calendar orchestration)
- Operations (cross-tool automation)
- Founders/execs (daily briefings, email triage)

## Content Strategy

### Phase 1: Demo Videos (Prove It Works)

Short-form (30-60 sec) for LinkedIn/Twitter/TikTok:

#### Demo 1: "One Sentence to Find Candidates"
- **Hook:** "I just replaced 20 minutes of ATS clicking with one sentence"
- **Show:** Type natural language query → get ranked candidates with fit analysis
- **Platform:** LinkedIn (primary), Twitter
- **Target:** Recruiters frustrated with ATS UI

#### Demo 2: "Weekly Report in 5 Seconds"
- **Hook:** "My Monday morning report now takes 5 seconds"
- **Show:** Type "recruiting metrics for Slack" → formatted report appears
- **Platform:** LinkedIn, Twitter
- **Target:** Recruiting managers, ops people

#### Demo 3: "Cross-Tool Magic"
- **Hook:** "Search ATS + draft emails + check calendar - one conversation"
- **Show:** Multi-step workflow completing in single chat
- **Platform:** LinkedIn, Twitter
- **Target:** Power users, ops people

#### Demo 4: "Your ATS + AI (No Migration Required)"
- **Hook:** "You don't need to switch to Gem to get AI recruiting"
- **Show:** Greenhouse/Lever user getting Gem-like capabilities
- **Platform:** LinkedIn
- **Target:** Greenhouse/Lever users considering Gem

### Phase 2: Comparison Content

#### Blog/Thread: "Gem vs Staying on Greenhouse + Skillomatic"
- Cost comparison ($20k+ vs current stack + Skillomatic)
- Migration pain avoided
- What you get vs what you give up
- Decision framework

#### Blog/Thread: "What Gem Does That You Actually Need"
- Break down Gem's features
- Which ones matter for your team size
- How to get 80% of value without switching

### Phase 3: Use Case Deep Dives

Longer content (2-5 min videos, blog posts):

1. **Candidate Search Workflows**
   - Natural language → ATS query
   - Fit analysis and ranking
   - Comparison to manual search

2. **Outreach Drafting**
   - Context-aware email generation
   - Personalization at scale
   - Integration with Gmail/Outlook

3. **Reporting Automation**
   - Pulling from multiple sources
   - Different formats (Slack, email, standup)
   - Real metrics, not manual compilation

4. **Non-Recruiting Workflows**
   - Sales: CRM + email orchestration
   - Ops: Cross-tool automation
   - Founders: Daily briefing setup

## Distribution Channels

### Tier 1 (Primary)
- **LinkedIn** - Where recruiters and ops people live
- **Twitter/X** - AI/dev crowd, tech recruiters

### Tier 2 (Secondary)
- **TikTok** - Higher reach ceiling, less targeted
- **YouTube Shorts** - Searchable, evergreen

### Tier 3 (Community)
- **Reddit** - r/recruiting, r/recruitinghell, r/sales
- **Slack/Discord** - Recruiting communities, AI communities
- **Hacker News** - Dev audience, technical credibility

## Demo Production Guidelines

### Format
- Vertical (9:16) for LinkedIn/TikTok/Shorts
- 30-60 seconds for short-form
- 2-3 minutes for deep dives

### Structure
1. **Hook (0-3 sec):** Problem statement or surprising result
2. **Setup (3-10 sec):** Quick context on what we're doing
3. **Demo (10-45 sec):** Show the actual workflow
4. **Result (45-60 sec):** What we accomplished, time saved

### Audio
- Voiceover or text overlay (many watch muted)
- Trending audio optional for TikTok reach

### Text
- Problem at start
- Key moments highlighted
- Result/CTA at end

## Messaging Framework

### Don't Say
- "Replace your ATS"
- "Better than Gem"
- "AI-powered recruiting platform"

### Do Say
- "Keep your Greenhouse/Lever, add AI"
- "Gem-like capabilities without the migration"
- "Natural language for your recruiting tools"
- "Claude for your ATS + email + calendar"

### Key Differentiators
1. **No migration required** - Works with existing tools
2. **Multi-tool orchestration** - Not just ATS, everything together
3. **Fraction of the cost** - Compared to Gem pricing
4. **Privacy-first** - Ephemeral architecture, no data stored

## Success Metrics

### Leading Indicators
- Video views/impressions
- Engagement rate (likes, comments, shares)
- Profile visits
- Website traffic from social

### Lagging Indicators
- Demo requests
- Sign-ups
- Consulting inquiries
- Barter partner interest

## Competitive Landscape Notes

### Gem (the 800lb gorilla)
- All-in-one: ATS + CRM + sourcing + email + scheduling + analytics
- $99/user/month (~$4k/seat/year)
- 650M+ profile database
- Native AI in every workflow
- Target: Mid-market to enterprise, well-funded startups

### Traditional ATS (our integration targets)
- **Greenhouse** - Structured hiring, DE&I focus, 1000+ integrations
- **Lever** - Beautiful UI, good CRM, $12k+/year
- **Ashby** - Modern, analytics-focused, rising
- **Workable** - SMB-friendly, 30k+ customers
- **Zoho Recruit** - Budget option, mobile-first

### Why Companies Stay on Traditional ATS
1. Sunk cost (already paid for setup, training)
2. Migration pain (data, workflows, integrations)
3. Cost (Gem is expensive)
4. "Good enough" (don't need all-in-one)
5. Compliance/IT requirements (enterprise)

## Founder Angle

### Why Founders

- **Influential** - Share tools they use, built-in distribution
- **High willingness to pay** - Value time savings highly
- **Less crowded** - Not as many players as recruiting/sales
- **Lighthouse customers** - A few happy founders > chasing founder market at scale

### Positioning for Founders

**"Claude that knows your whole business"**

Not another AI assistant app - Claude connected to YOUR tools. Each founder's stack is different, but common elements:
- Gmail/Calendar for scheduling + communication
- Sheets/Airtable for metrics + data
- Notion for docs (limited API)
- Slack (restricted - see below)

### Competition: Lindy AI

Lindy is the main player in AI executive assistant space:
- 3000+ integrations
- "AI employee" positioning
- No-code workflow builder
- Pricing: expensive, custom quotes
- Reviews: powerful but inconsistent, steep learning curve

**Our angle vs Lindy:**
- Claude-native (better reasoning than GPT-4 for complex tasks)
- Simpler - not trying to be everything
- Consulting model - we build it for you, not DIY

### Founder-Specific Demos

#### Demo F1: "Morning Briefing"
- **Hook:** "My AI knows what I need to know before I check anything"
- **Show:** One prompt → calendar summary + priority emails + key metrics
- **Integrations:** Gmail + Google Calendar + Sheets/Airtable
- **Platform:** Twitter/X, LinkedIn

#### Demo F2: "Prep Me for This Meeting"
- **Hook:** "I walked into every meeting this week fully prepared"
- **Show:** "Prep me for my 2pm" → pulls email history, past notes, company context
- **Integrations:** Gmail + Calendar + Airtable
- **Platform:** Twitter/X

#### Demo F3: "Investor Update Draft"
- **Hook:** "Monthly investor updates used to take 2 hours"
- **Show:** "Draft investor update" → pulls metrics from Sheets, writes email
- **Integrations:** Gmail + Sheets
- **Platform:** LinkedIn, Twitter/X

#### Demo F4: "What Fell Through the Cracks"
- **Hook:** "Nothing slips through anymore"
- **Show:** "What emails need responses this week" → surfaces unanswered threads
- **Integrations:** Gmail
- **Platform:** Twitter/X

### Integration Constraints

| Tool | API Status | Feasibility |
|------|------------|-------------|
| Gmail | Open, good scopes | Yes |
| Google Calendar | Open | Yes |
| Google Sheets | Open | Yes |
| Airtable | Open | Yes |
| Notion | Limited API | Partial |
| Slack | Locked down May 2025 | No (15 msg/min rate limit) |
| Linear | Open | Yes |
| Figma | Read-only | Partial |

**Slack note:** As of May 2025, Slack severely rate-limited `conversations.history` for non-Marketplace apps (15 messages/min). Not viable without Marketplace approval. Skip for now.

**Focus on:** Gmail + Calendar + Sheets/Airtable. These cover 80% of founder workflows.

### Founder Content Strategy

**Goal:** Lighthouse customers, not primary market

1. Create 2-3 founder demos (F1, F2, F3)
2. Post on Twitter/X where founders hang out
3. Target founders who post about productivity/tools
4. Convert a few to happy users
5. Get them to share (organic distribution)
6. Use as case studies for consulting pitch

**Don't:** Try to scale founder market. Each founder needs custom setup. Use them for credibility, not volume.

### Founder Messaging

**Don't say:**
- "AI assistant" (too generic, Lindy territory)
- "Automate your day" (oversells)

**Do say:**
- "Claude connected to your tools"
- "One conversation, all your context"
- "Stop context-switching between apps"

## Solopreneur Angle (High Priority)

### Why Solopreneurs

**The market is exploding:**
- 29.8 million solopreneurs in U.S. (rising dramatically)
- 50.9% of workforce will be freelancers by 2027
- $1.7 trillion economic contribution
- 77% profitable in first year
- 20% earn $100k-$300k with zero employees

**Why it's growing:**
- Corporate jobs disappearing (AI, downsizing)
- Gen Z skipping traditional employment entirely
- AI tools make one-person businesses viable
- 95-98% cost reduction vs hiring (tech stack = $3k-12k/year)

### The Pain Points (Our Opportunity)

| Pain | Data | Current Solution |
|------|------|------------------|
| Admin overwhelm | 60% underestimated how many hats they'd wear | Fragmented tools |
| Tool fragmentation | "Too many tools that don't talk to each other" | DIY with Zapier (complex) |
| Role switching | 10-40% of day on manual admin tasks | Nothing - just suffer |
| Decision fatigue | Constant context switching drains energy | Nothing |
| Can't delegate | No team, VAs cost $2-5k/month | Do it yourself |

**Key stat:** 90% of workers feel burdened by tasks they know could be automated.

### What They Use Now

Typical solopreneur stack ($150-300/month):
- **Organization:** Notion, ClickUp, Asana
- **Automation:** Zapier, Make (but complex to set up)
- **AI:** ChatGPT, Claude (already paying for this)
- **Design:** Canva
- **Email marketing:** MailerLite, ConvertKit
- **Scheduling:** Calendly, TidyCal
- **Payments:** Stripe
- **Data:** Airtable, Google Sheets

**The gap:** These tools don't talk to each other. Zapier/Make require technical setup. They're doing manual glue work constantly.

### Positioning for Solopreneurs

**"Claude that runs your business ops"**

Not another tool in the stack - the intelligent glue that connects everything they already use.

**Key insight:** They already pay for Claude/ChatGPT. Skillomatic makes that subscription 10x more valuable by connecting it to their actual business data.

### Solopreneur-Specific Demos

#### Demo S1: "What's Overdue?"
- **Hook:** "I stopped letting invoices slip through the cracks"
- **Show:** "What invoices are overdue?" → pulls from Stripe + Sheets, lists clients to follow up
- **Integrations:** Stripe + Google Sheets
- **Platform:** Twitter/X, TikTok

#### Demo S2: "Revive Cold Leads"
- **Hook:** "I just found $10k in leads I forgot about"
- **Show:** "Draft follow-ups for leads who went cold" → scans Airtable + Gmail, drafts personalized emails
- **Integrations:** Gmail + Airtable
- **Platform:** Twitter/X, LinkedIn

#### Demo S3: "Prep My Day"
- **Hook:** "I know exactly what to focus on before I open my laptop"
- **Show:** "What's on my plate today?" → calendar + tasks + pending client items
- **Integrations:** Google Calendar + Airtable + Gmail
- **Platform:** Twitter/X, TikTok

#### Demo S4: "Weekly Revenue Check"
- **Hook:** "My Monday financial review takes 30 seconds"
- **Show:** "How'd we do last week?" → revenue from Stripe, expenses, formatted summary
- **Integrations:** Stripe + Sheets
- **Platform:** Twitter/X, LinkedIn

#### Demo S5: "Client Status Update"
- **Hook:** "I never forget where things stand with a client"
- **Show:** "What's the status with [client name]?" → pulls emails, invoices, project notes
- **Integrations:** Gmail + Stripe + Airtable
- **Platform:** Twitter/X

### Competition for Solopreneurs

| Competitor | Positioning | Weakness |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Zapier/Make | Automation platform | Complex setup, not conversational |
| Lindy AI | AI employee | Expensive, inconsistent, steep learning curve |
| ChatGPT/Claude alone | General AI | No tool connections, manual copy-paste |
| Virtual assistants | Human help | $2-5k/month, async, training required |

**Our angle:**
- Simpler than Zapier (just talk to it)
- Cheaper than Lindy or VA
- More powerful than raw ChatGPT (actually connected to your tools)

### Solopreneur Pricing Strategy

**Sweet spot:** $50-100/month
- Less than a VA ($2-5k/month)
- Comparable to their other tools
- Justifiable if it saves 5+ hours/week
- 6 hrs/week saved = $30/hr value = $720/month value

**Positioning:** "Less than your Notion subscription, saves more time than all your other tools combined"

### Solopreneur Distribution

**Primary channels:**
- **Twitter/X** - Solopreneur/indie hacker community is huge here
- **TikTok** - "Day in my life as solopreneur" content does well
- **YouTube** - "My tech stack" videos get views

**Communities:**
- r/solopreneur, r/Entrepreneur, r/freelance
- Indie Hackers
- Twitter communities around #buildinpublic, #solopreneur

**Influencers to watch:**
- Solopreneurs with 10k-100k followers who post about productivity
- "Build in public" founders
- Productivity/tools reviewers

### Solopreneur Content Strategy

**Goal:** Volume play - this is a scalable market unlike founders

**Approach:**
1. Create 3-4 punchy demos (S1-S4)
2. Post consistently on Twitter/X and TikTok
3. Target solopreneur hashtags and communities
4. Build waitlist / early access list
5. Offer simple onboarding (connect Gmail + Sheets + Stripe)
6. Land-and-expand: start with one workflow, add more

**Content themes:**
- "I automated X" (specific task)
- "My AI handles this now" (before/after)
- "Stop doing this manually" (pain point callout)
- "One-person business hack" (lifestyle angle)

### Solopreneur Messaging

**Don't say:**
- "AI assistant" (generic, crowded)
- "Automation platform" (sounds complex)
- "Workflow builder" (they don't want to build)

**Do say:**
- "Claude for your business"
- "Your tools, finally talking to each other"
- "Ask questions, get answers from your actual data"
- "The glue your tech stack is missing"

### Solopreneur vs Founder Comparison

| Aspect | Founders | Solopreneurs |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Market size | Small | Large (30M in U.S.) |
| Customization needed | High (each is unique) | Medium (common stacks) |
| Willingness to pay | Very high | Medium-high |
| Distribution | Word of mouth | Content marketing |
| Scalability | Low (consulting) | High (self-serve) |
| Role | Lighthouse/credibility | Volume/revenue |

**Strategy:** Use founders for credibility and case studies. Use solopreneurs for scale and revenue.

## Notes

- Gem does NOT have a public API that enables third-party AI tools - their AI is proprietary
- Gem API requires contacting sales for access (not self-serve)
- Traditional ATS (Greenhouse, Lever) have more open APIs
- This is our moat: we can integrate with the ATS that Gem competes against
- Slack locked down API in May 2025 - not a viable integration target without Marketplace approval
- Solopreneur market is 29.8M in U.S. and growing - larger addressable market than recruiting
