# Lean Canvas: Mid-Size Landlord AI Leasing Assistant

**Date:** 2026-01-29
**Status:** Testable Hypothesis
**Confidence:** Medium - needs customer validation

---

## TL;DR

**Target:** 5-20 unit landlords (self-managing)
**Problem:** Drowning in low-quality inquiries, no affordable automation
**Solution:** AI leasing assistant that qualifies leads and books showings
**Price:** $29-49/mo flat (undercuts Tenant Turner's $50 min)
**TAM:** ~1.5M landlords in this segment

---

## 1. Problem

1. Mid-size landlords get 20-50+ inquiries per vacancy
2. 95% are spam, "is it available?", or unqualified
3. Back-and-forth scheduling wastes hours per vacancy
4. Multiple vacancies per year = real ongoing pain
5. Existing tools either free (no automation) or enterprise ($250+/mo)

**The money problem:**
- Empty unit costs ~$50/day in lost rent
- Every day spent sorting garbage inquiries = money lost
- No-shows waste time driving to property

---

## 2. Customer Segment

### Primary: 5-20 Unit Landlords
- Self-managing (no property manager)
- Multiple vacancies per year (3-8+)
- List on Craigslist, FB Marketplace, Zillow
- Have a day job - landlording is side business
- Time-constrained, can't respond instantly

### Why This Segment (Not Smaller or Larger)

| Segment | Units | Vacancies/yr | Pain Level | Will Pay? |
|---------|-------|--------------|------------|-----------|
| 1-2 units | 1-2 | 1-2 | Low | No - not worth it |
| 3-4 units | 3-4 | 2-4 | Medium | Maybe |
| **5-20 units** | 5-20 | 5-10+ | **High** | **Yes** |
| 20+ units | 20+ | 10+ | High | Already have tools |

### Market Size

- 91% of landlords own 10 or fewer units
- 16% own 5-10 units = ~1.6M landlords
- ~10% own 11-20 units (some overlap)
- **Addressable market: ~1.5M landlords**

---

## 3. Unique Value Proposition

> "AI leasing assistant for 5-20 unit landlords. $29/mo flat. No minimums."

**Alternative hooks:**
- "Stop answering 'is it available?' - AI handles inquiries, you just show up"
- "Fill vacancies faster. Qualified prospects only."
- "Every day a unit sits empty costs $50. Stop wasting time on tire-kickers."

## 4. Solution

### The Funnel

```
Listing goes live (Zillow/CL/FB/TurboTenant)
                    ↓
    [US] Unified inbox captures all inquiries
    [US] AI responds instantly (24/7)
    [US] Qualifies: income, pets, move-in date, etc.
    [US] Qualified leads get Calendly link
    [US] Auto-confirms, reminds, reduces no-shows
                    ↓
    Landlord shows up to pre-vetted prospect
                    ↓
    Application/screening (TurboTenant/Avail)
                    ↓
    Lease signing (existing tools)
```

### Core Features

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| Unified inbox | CL + FB + Zillow + email in one place |
| AI auto-response | Instant reply to every inquiry, 24/7 |
| Pre-qualification | Asks screening questions (income, pets, timeline) |
| Smart scheduling | Calendly integration, available times only |
| Reminders | Auto-confirm, reduce no-shows |
| Lead tracking | See all prospects, status, conversations |

### What We Don't Do (Complement, Don't Compete)

- Listing syndication (TurboTenant does this)
- Rent collection (TurboTenant/Avail)
- Tenant screening (TransUnion)
- Lease generation (existing tools)

## 5. Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Pricing | Minimum | Target | Our Advantage |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|---------------|
| **Tenant Turner** | $1/unit, $50 min | 50 units | SMB PMs | No minimum, simpler |
| **ShowMojo** | $69-1800/mo | 100+ units | Large PMs | Way cheaper, no minimum |
| **AppFolio (Lisa)** | $280+/mo | 50+ units | Mid-large | 10x cheaper |
| **Leasey.AI** | $$$ | Enterprise | Large portfolios | Accessible pricing |
| **TenantCloud** | Free-$$ | None | Small | More AI, less manual |
| **TurboTenant** | Free | None | Small | We add lead qualification |
| **Gmail canned responses** | Free | None | DIY | Actually intelligent |

### The Gap We Fill

**5-20 unit landlords are in no-man's land:**
- Too big to ignore inquiries (multiple vacancies/year)
- Too small for enterprise tools ($250+/mo minimums)
- Tenant Turner works but $50 minimum + per-unit fees
- Free tools (TurboTenant) don't do lead qualification

## 9. Unfair Advantages

1. **Browser extension** - Scrapes auth pages (CL inbox) where others can't
2. **Existing infrastructure** - MCP + integrations + chat already built
3. **Price disruption** - 10x below enterprise, no minimums
4. **Complement positioning** - Works with TurboTenant, not against

---

## 10. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| Landlords too cheap to pay | Medium | Focus on 5-20 units where ROI is clear |
| Craigslist scraping breaks | Medium | Multi-channel (Zillow, FB, email) |
| TurboTenant adds this feature | Medium | Move fast, build relationships |
| Hard to reach target users | High | Cold outreach to active listings |
| AI responses feel robotic | Low | Tune prompts, allow customization |

---

## 11. Validation Plan

### Phase 1: Problem Validation (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Post in r/landlord asking about inquiry pain
- [ ] Cold email 20 landlords with active CL listings
- [ ] Book 5 calls with 5-20 unit landlords
- [ ] Ask: "Walk me through your last vacancy - how many inquiries, how long to fill?"

### Phase 2: Solution Validation (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] Mock up AI conversation flow
- [ ] Show mockups in customer calls
- [ ] Ask: "Would you pay $29/mo for this?"
- [ ] Get 3 verbal commits or kill the idea

### Phase 3: MVP (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Build basic email → AI → Calendly flow
- [ ] Onboard 3-5 beta users (free or discounted)
- [ ] Measure: inquiries handled, showings booked, feedback

### Kill Criteria
- If <3/10 landlords say they'd pay → pivot
- If tech can't reliably capture inquiries → pivot
- If no one uses it after free trial → pivot
