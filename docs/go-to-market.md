# Skillomatic Go-to-Market Strategy

## What is Skillomatic?

**Headline:** Claude/ChatGPT + Your Tools = Actual Automation

I build MCP servers that connect your AI assistant to your business tools. You tell me what's repetitive and painful, I connect your AI so it can actually do the work — on command, on a schedule, or triggered by events.

**Target audience:** Early adopters who already use Claude Desktop or ChatGPT and want to connect them to their actual work tools (ATS, CRM, email, calendar, etc.)

**Wedge:** MCP. The people who know what it is are actively looking for someone to help them use it.

## Business Model

### Consulting-First (Primary)

| Offering | Price | Details |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Discovery Call** | Free | 30 min. Understand workflow, assess feasibility, no commitment |
| **Automation Build** | Custom | End-to-end workflow automation, connected to real systems, typically done in 1-2 days |
| **Ongoing Retainer** | Custom | Priority support, adjustments, new automations as needed |

**Why custom pricing:**
- Lets me qualify leads on the call
- Avoids scaring off small clients or leaving money on table with bigger ones
- Each workflow is different in complexity

### Self-Serve (Secondary)

Always available, no gatekeeping. For DIY users who want to set it up themselves.

| Tier | Price | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Free** | $0/month | 500 tool calls/month, basic integrations |
| **Pro** | $29/month | 5,000 tool calls/month, all integrations |
| **Team** | $99/month | 25,000 tool calls/month, multiple users |

**Why keep self-serve:**
- Captures leads who aren't ready for consulting
- Recurring revenue foundation
- Some people prefer DIY

## Positioning

### What Makes This Different

| Traditional Consulting | Skillomatic |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Generic advice and a deck | Working automation you can use immediately |
| Months of implementation | Delivered in 1-2 days |
| Requires IT involvement | OAuth connections, no IT tickets |
| You still do the work | AI does the work; you review and approve |

### Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Skillomatic Advantage |
|------------|----------------------|
| **Zapier/Make** | AI-native, conversational, handles complex logic |
| **Generic AI chatbots** | Actually takes actions, connected to real tools |
| **Automation agencies** | Faster delivery, runs in user's own AI assistant |
| **In-house development** | No hiring, no maintenance, done in days |

## Target Personas

### Primary: Technical Early Adopter

- Already uses Claude Desktop or ChatGPT daily
- Has seen MCP, maybe tried to configure it
- Frustrated that AI gives suggestions but doesn't do the work
- Has budget authority for small consulting engagements

### Secondary: Ops/RevOps Lead

- Manages business tool stack
- Drowning in repetitive workflows
- Interested in AI but doesn't know where to start
- Needs ROI justification

### Tertiary: Small Business Owner

- Wears many hats
- Doing tasks that should be automated
- Would pay to get time back

---

## Sales Motion

### Discovery Call Flow (30 min)

1. **Understand pain** (10 min): "Walk me through a task you do repeatedly. How many tools do you touch?"
2. **Explain solution** (5 min): Brief explanation of MCP, how it works
3. **Scope the build** (10 min): What tools? What triggers? What outputs?
4. **Next steps** (5 min): Quote or follow-up

### Qualification Questions

- Do you already use Claude Desktop or ChatGPT?
- What repetitive task takes the most time?
- What tools are involved in that workflow?
- Do you have admin access to those tools?

### Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "What's MCP?" | "It's a new standard that lets AI assistants connect to external tools. Think USB for AI." |
| "Can't ChatGPT already do this?" | "It can suggest actions, but not take them. This actually clicks buttons and moves data." |
| "Is my data secure?" | "Your data stays in your systems. The AI calls your tools directly via OAuth." |
| "What if it breaks?" | "Retainer includes support. Or self-serve users can reach out for consulting." |
| "Too expensive" | "What's your hourly rate? How many hours per week on this task?" |

## Open Questions
