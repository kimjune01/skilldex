# Skillomatic Go-to-Market Strategy

## What is Skillomatic?

Skillomatic brings recruiting tools directly into Claude. Instead of switching between LinkedIn, your ATS, email, and calendar, recruiters just talk to Claude: "Find senior engineers in Seattle" → "Add the top 3 to our ATS" → "Draft outreach emails."

Self-hosted on customer infrastructure. We never touch their data.

## The ROI Story

Lead with this in every conversation:

```
Recruiter salary: $80,000/year ($40/hour)
Time saved: 4 hours/week (conservative estimate)
Annual savings: 4 × 52 × $40 = $8,320 per recruiter
Skillomatic cost: $79 × 12 = $948/year
ROI: 778%
Payback period: 6 weeks
```

**One-liner:** "Skillomatic pays for itself if it saves each recruiter one hour per week. We typically see 4+."

## Pricing Model

Self-hosted on customer infrastructure = no security burden on us, full data control for them.

### Per-Seat License

| Tier | Price | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Design Partner** | Free → $49/user/month | Free for 3 months, then discounted. Monthly feedback calls, case study rights |
| **Standard** | $79/user/month | Min 5 seats ($395/month). All skills, updates, email support |
| **Volume** | $59/user/month | 20+ seats. Priority support, quarterly custom skill development |

**Why this works:**
- $395/month floor closes without VP approval
- Per-seat is familiar to HR buyers
- No usage metering = simple billing
- Healthy margins (no infra costs)

**We handle:** Skills, updates, support, deployment docs
**They handle:** Hosting, data, security compliance

### Future Options

- **Flat fee** ($500-$3k/month): For enterprises who hate counting seats
- **Perpetual license** ($10-50k + 20% annual): For those who hate subscriptions

## Competitive Positioning

| Tool | Skillomatic Advantage |
|------|-------------------|
| **LinkedIn Recruiter** | We integrate with it, not replace it. Add AI layer on top of their existing subscription |
| **ChatGPT/generic AI** | We take actions (add to ATS, send emails). They just give advice |
| **Gem, Fetcher, HireEZ** | We're workflow-first, not database-first. Works with their existing tools |
| **ATS built-in AI** | We work across tools. ATS AI only works in that one system |

**Positioning statement:** "Skillomatic is the AI layer that connects all your recruiting tools through natural language."

## Sales Playbook

### Hooks by Persona

| Persona | Hook |
|---------|------|
| Recruiter | "Stop switching between 5 tabs to do one task" |
| Ops Lead | "Give recruiters AI superpowers without security headaches" |
| VP | "10x productivity without 10x headcount" |

### The Killer Discovery Question

> "Walk me through sourcing a candidate yesterday. How many tools did you touch, and how many times did you copy-paste something?"

If they can't answer quickly, they've lost track—which proves the pain.

### Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We have an ATS" | "We make your ATS easier to use, not replace it" |
| "Team isn't technical" | "If they can chat with Claude, they can use Skillomatic" |
| "Data is sensitive" | "It runs on your servers. We never see your data" |
| "Need security review" | "Happy to share architecture docs. Your infra, your audit" |
| "No budget" | "It's $79/recruiter. Pays for itself if it saves 2 hours/month" |

### Demo Flow (15 min)

1. **Pain setup** (2 min): Open LinkedIn, ATS, Email tabs. "This is 50x/day."
2. **Search** (3 min): "Find senior Python engineers in Seattle with AWS" → ranked results
3. **Action** (3 min): "Add top candidate to ATS with notes" → done
4. **Outreach** (2 min): "Draft personalized email" → ready to send
5. **Admin** (2 min): Show usage logs, access controls
6. **Close** (3 min): "5 minutes vs 30. Want to try with your data?"

### First Customer Offers

1. **Founder access** - "My cell number. Feedback shapes the product"
2. **Free pilot** - "3 months free, then 40% off first year"
3. **Custom skills** - "We'll build 3 skills for your specific workflow"
4. **White-glove setup** - "I'll deploy it and train your team personally"

## Hypotheses to Validate

### Must Prove (P0)

| # | Hypothesis | How to Validate | Success Criteria |
|---|------------|-----------------|------------------|
| 1 | Tool-switching is a top pain | 10 discovery calls | 8/10 rank it top-3 problem |
| 2 | They'll try when shown | Demo to 20 recruiters | 50% agree to pilot |
| 3 | They'll pay after trying | Track pilot conversions | 30% convert at $49+/user |

**If all three pass:** Go aggressive.
**If any fail:** Pivot or kill.

### Should Validate (P1)

| # | Hypothesis | Risk if Wrong |
|---|------------|---------------|
| 4 | Claude familiarity is high enough | Need to educate market, higher CAC |
| 5 | Teams adopt virally (1 user → team) | Need enterprise sales motion |
| 6 | Self-hosted is a selling point, not friction | May need managed option |

### Can Defer (P2)

| # | Hypothesis | Risk if Wrong |
|---|------------|---------------|
| 7 | ATS integrations generalize across systems | Need vendor-specific code |
| 8 | Skill architecture scales to complex workflows | Need plugin system |
| 9 | Technical recruiters are the right beachhead | Market may be broader |
